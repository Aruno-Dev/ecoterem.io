Hi people !

As I am still studying web development I can practice my basis on such small real life projects.

Here is a temporary one-page site for a company of my actual company.

I chose to make it simple, html and css.

For those who are familiar with web development not much to say, for the others I don't think you are reading this. Actually I think nobody will ever read this.

Anyway, it is better to create a readme file so I did it.

Have a great day !
